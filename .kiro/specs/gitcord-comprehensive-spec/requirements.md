# GitCord Requirements Document

## Introduction

GitCord is a Discord bot designed to enable GitOps-based Discord server management through YAML configuration templates. The bot allows server administrators to define, version control, and automatically deploy Discord server structures (channels, categories, permissions) using declarative YAML files. This approach brings infrastructure-as-code principles to Discord server management, enabling reproducible, scalable, and maintainable server configurations.

The system supports both manual template application and planned automatic synchronization with GitHub repositories, making it suitable for communities that want to manage their Discord server structure alongside their codebase or documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: YAML Template Management

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to define my server structure using YAML templates, so that I can version control and reproduce my server configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a channel YAML template THEN the system SHALL accept templates with name, type, topic, position, nsfw, and user_limit fields
2. WHEN a user creates a category YAML template THEN the system SHALL accept templates with name, type, position, and channels array fields
3. WHEN a YAML template contains invalid syntax THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific syntax issues
4. WHEN a YAML template is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL validate and report which required fields are missing
5. IF a YAML template references non-existent channel files THEN the system SHALL report the missing dependencies

### Requirement 2: Discord Channel Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to create channels and categories from YAML templates, so that I can quickly set up consistent server structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes the createchannel command THEN the system SHALL create a single Discord channel based on the specified YAML template
2. WHEN a user executes the createcategory command THEN the system SHALL create a Discord category with all specified child channels
3. WHEN creating channels THEN the system SHALL respect Discord's channel type constraints (text, voice, category)
4. WHEN creating channels THEN the system SHALL apply position, topic, NSFW settings, and user limits as specified in templates
5. WHEN a channel or category already exists THEN the system SHALL update existing channels rather than create duplicates
6. WHEN updating existing channels THEN the system SHALL preserve existing messages and channel history

### Requirement 3: Permission and Security Management

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to ensure only authorized users can modify server structure, so that my server remains secure and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to use channel management commands THEN the system SHALL verify the user has "Manage Channels" permission
2. WHEN a user attempts to use administrative commands THEN the system SHALL verify the user has "Administrator" permission
3. WHEN processing templates THEN the system SHALL validate all input to prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN handling external URLs THEN the system SHALL implement proper sanitization and validation
5. IF a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL provide clear permission error messages

### Requirement 4: Git Integration and Template Synchronization

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to synchronize my server structure with a Git repository, so that I can manage server configuration alongside my project code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL clone the repository to a local template directory
2. WHEN applying templates from a repository THEN the system SHALL process all YAML files in the specified directory structure
3. WHEN a repository is updated THEN the system SHALL support pulling the latest changes via git pull command
4. WHEN cloning repositories THEN the system SHALL support specifying custom branches using the -b flag
5. IF repository access fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about connectivity or permission issues

### Requirement 5: Command Interface and User Experience

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to interact with GitCord through both slash commands and prefix commands, so that I can use the interface that's most convenient for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is active THEN the system SHALL support both slash commands (/) and prefix commands (!)
2. WHEN a user requests help THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive command documentation and usage examples
3. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback with success or error messages
4. WHEN processing long operations THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and progress updates
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 6: Template Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want clear feedback when my templates have issues, so that I can quickly fix configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YAML parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific line numbers and syntax error descriptions
2. WHEN template validation fails THEN the system SHALL list all validation errors in a single response
3. WHEN channel creation fails THEN the system SHALL report which specific channels failed and why
4. WHEN Discord API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with appropriate delays
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry operations with exponential backoff

### Requirement 7: Bulk Operations and Category Management

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to create multiple channels and categories efficiently, so that I can set up complex server structures quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a category with multiple channels THEN the system SHALL create all channels within the category in the correct order
2. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and final summaries
3. WHEN some channels in a bulk operation fail THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining channels and report all results
4. WHEN categories contain existing channels THEN the system SHALL handle updates to existing channels appropriately
5. WHEN extra channels exist in a category THEN the system SHALL offer options to remove or keep unmanaged channels

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure GitCord for different environments, so that I can deploy it securely across development and production instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables and .env files
2. WHEN Discord token is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required configuration
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration overrides
5. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL never log or expose tokens or credentials

### Requirement 9: Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of bot operations, so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot performs operations THEN the system SHALL log all significant events with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL log command usage with user and guild information
4. WHEN API operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log Discord API interactions for debugging
5. WHEN the bot starts or stops THEN the system SHALL log startup and shutdown events with version information

### Requirement 10: Extensibility and Modularity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend GitCord with additional functionality, so that I can customize it for specific community needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL support the Discord.py cog architecture for modular development
2. WHEN new commands are added THEN the system SHALL automatically register them with the command system
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide base classes and utilities for consistent development patterns
4. WHEN custom cogs are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle loading errors gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN the bot is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing templates and configurations
